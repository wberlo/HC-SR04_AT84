# HC-SR04_AT84
sonar range finder library for Atmel AT84
library with functionality for the HC-SR04 sonar range finder, driven by an Atmel ATtiny AT84.

I've successfully compiled and used this code with Atmel Studio 6.2

Most of the functions in this library are selfexplanatory.
The code assumes that the internal clock is used with the prescaler (1 MHz).
Minor(?) changes have to be made if you plan to use it with an 8 MHz clock.

The source code is commented.
Feel free to use as is.
